# AP CS A
All my AP Computer Science A projects; Edhesive and otherwise.

In the `Edhesive` directory, all lessons, assignments, and labs from Edhesive are contained.  
In the `Classwork` directory, all assigned classwork from my teacher is contained.  
In the `Projects` directory, any project ideas, usually incomplete, are stored.

My Edhesive notes - 
[Term 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6Rls4UQYV9ClJXALKBT052FmIh1V8FyzfhAzY3juFg/edit?usp=sharing)
and [Term 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3BIyxFoaHIHK9gwf9uO1_WD_g7jn5UNbkiUr42U90w/edit?usp=sharing)

These notes are only based on the lesson summaries, and as such likely do not contain enough information to learn from. In fact, there's barely enough information to understand the lesson; just enough for me to jog my memory about the contents of it. I wouldn't rely on 'em, as they were taken by someone (me) who already understood the fundamentals of a different programming language (JavaScript).

Enjoy.
